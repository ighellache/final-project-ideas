#### Project Name
    Finding the field I want to work for
   
#### Describe the problem you'd like to solve
   As an upcoming junior developer I would like to explore further options in the field I'm interested, such as medtech, but it is tiring having to filter and search on google for a niche field. So I would like to create a job board where the user can filter through different fields of tech, e.g. fintech, medtech and edutech. 
   
#### Who are the stakeholders?
    Applying developers.
   
#### Other considerations
   Need to see what APIs to use, any permissions I'd have to bypass. 
   
#### What is currently being done to solve this problem?
   There is currently the https://juniordeveloper.careers/about-us website. 

#### What technology might be interesting to explore?
    APIs, using new technologies like REACT and NEXT javascript
